# Solar-Radiation-Calculator

The main aim is to calculate the solar radiation (direct normal irradiance + diffuse horizontal irradiance) values at a particular location with or without the consideration of cloud coverage.

The calculation needs longitude and latitude values of the selected location, altitude and local time.

An API call is required to get the sunrise and sunset time, local time and cloud covrage values.
